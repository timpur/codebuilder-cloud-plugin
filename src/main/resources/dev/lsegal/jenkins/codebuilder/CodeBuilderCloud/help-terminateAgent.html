<p>Determines whether to terminate the codebuild Agent after the task is finished.</p>
<p>
  After a task is finished default behavior is to terminate the codebuild agent
  right after the build is finished. By disabling this option the codebuild agent 
  will run for the amount of time specified by the Agent Connection Timeout. Each new build
  will extend the Agent runtime for the Agent Connection Timeout value.
